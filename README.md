# vim-repo-edit

Clone and edit a git repository directly from vim.


## Why?

I often want to _read_ code on a GitHub repo. I'm lazy. Don't make me clone it, open it in vim, and remember to delete it when I'm done.


## Installation

Install with a plugin manager.


## Usage

```
:RepoEdit https://github.com/drzel/vim-repo-edit.git
```
