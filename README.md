# vim-repo-edit

One second to read GitHub code with vim. Inspired by [github1s](https://github.com/conwnet/github1s).


## Why?

I often want to _read_ code on a GitHub repo. I'm lazy. Don't make me clone it, open it in vim, and remember to delete it when I'm done.


## Installation

Install with a plugin manager.


## Usage

Any of the following formats work fine.

```
:RepoEdit https://github.com/drzel/vim-repo-edit
:RepoEdit https://github.com/drzel/vim-repo-edit.git
:RepoEdit git@github.com:drzel/vim-repo-edit.git
```
